A: Hi, I'm looking for the Helix Lab corporation.
B: That's IT company?
A: Yes, I'm late, could you help me?
B: Of course, It's near to the Hungarian National Theater. Go ahead and the entrance is the left side. The sign "Swan Yard" is written above the entrance.
A: Thank you!


- Since we have to do this together, we should meet somewhere where we can do it.
- How about you come over to my place, it's quiet and not far from here.

- If you go down Kir√°ly Street, turn left on Majorossy Imre Street. There you have to walk past the church on Agostino Square and go down Vince Street to number 21.
- Okay, let's go.
