My sister and her boyfriend are similar in some ways, but they are also very different. They have brown eyes and brown hair. But my sister's hair is dark blue right now, because she has dyed it. My sister's hair is short, but her boyfriend's hair is very long. He doesn't like fruit and vegetables, but my sister loves them. They work as graphic designers and study at PTE-MK. They like reality shows and they love each other.
